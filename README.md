# Harmony

This is the repository of the backend of discord clone application to demonstrate my understanding of the core features of Elixir.  
The backend will serve responses to requests from mobile app client side to enable its features.

## Language Versions.
This repository is made using `Elixir 1.12.0-dev` and its required `Erlang/OTP 23`.
